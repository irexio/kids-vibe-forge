            In a world where technology never stops evolving, the way we learn to create with it has to evolve, too.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Kids Vibe Coding Club introduces a new way to learn â€” vibe coding.
            It's coding powered by imagination and guided by AI.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Instead of memorizing commands or worrying about syntax, kids learn to direct AI tools, design real projects, and understand how code comes to life.
